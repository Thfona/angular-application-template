# Angular Application Template

Starter template for an Angular application with a variety of pre-configured tools. 

## FAQ

### What is this?

This a template for starting development on an Angular application.

### Doesn't Angular already have a template to get started with?

Yes, but there a lot of tools and configurations that I like to use on basically every application I build.
This template makes it easy to get started without having to worry about setting everything up.

### How do I use this template to start development on my own application?

With 3 simple steps:

1. Replace "YOUR-PROJECT-NAME" with your project's title name (e.g. "My App").
2. Replace "your-project-name" with your project's repository name (e.g. "my-app").
3. Remove this part of the README.

That's it! Now you can start developing your application.
